# My Portfolio <sub>by Ruben Del Pozo</sub>
This portfolio is a single-page application (SPA) built with HTML. It features several sections where I introduce myself, highlight my skills, and showcase some of my personal and professional projects.
The content is dynamically loaded from a local JSON file that simulates a database. Some visual elements and icons are enhanced using the Font Awesome library.
The layout is fully responsive, with smooth section transitions for an intuitive browsing experience. The contact section includes a simple form to make it easy for visitors to get in touch. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages.

Technologies used: `HTML`, `JavaScript`, `CSS`, `JSON`
